# 🌱 ReVive: Transform Household Items into Creative Masterpieces!  

ReVive is an innovative upcycling app that encourages sustainability by providing creative upcycling ideas for household items. Whether you're looking to repurpose an old jar or transform a cardboard box into something extraordinary, ReVive has you covered!

## 🌟 Inspiration

The inspiration behind ReVive was to promote a sustainable lifestyle by encouraging individuals to breathe new life into old household items. With machine learning and AI, ReVive bridges the gap between environmental consciousness and creativity.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. 📸 **Upload or Capture an Image**: Users can upload a picture of a household item or use their camera to take a photo.
2. 🤖 **Prediction**: Our fine-tuned ResNet50 model predicts the item in the image (trained on 25 different labels with 90% accuracy).
3. 💡 **AI Suggestions:** The app automatically uses GPT-4 to generate personalized upcycling ideas based on the prediction and user preferences (location, time, and budget that is asked when signed up).
4. ✏️ **Manual Input:** If the user thinks the prediction is wrong, they can manually enter the item they want to upcycle to receive updated suggestions.
5. 🎥 **YouTube Integration**: The app fetches related YouTube videos using the YouTube API to provide visual inspiration for the upcycling process.
6. 🖥️ **Frontend Display**: All suggestions and videos are presented in an easy-to-navigate interface for users to explore.
